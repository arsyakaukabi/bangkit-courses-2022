# PROBLEM B2
#
# Build a classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
# The test will expect it to classify 10 classes.
# The input shape should be 28x28 monochrome. Do not resize the data.
# Your input layer should accept (28, 28) as the input shape.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
#
# Desired accuracy AND validation_accuracy > 83%
# =============================================================================
